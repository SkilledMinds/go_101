# go_101

Welcome to the SkilledMinds Go Repository!

The goal of this repo is to list basic and advance code of golang. Keep visiting to learn more examples over here.
Soon I will push a cloud native REST based application which will run in GKE.   



# Try your first GO program
      Install Go in your local and set GOPATH and GOROOT. 
      Create a project folder and then run below commands
        
   ##### 1. The "go mod init" command creates a go.mod file to track your code's dependencies
     go mod init
   ##### 2. To pull dependencies we need to run below command
     go mod tidy
  ##### 3. copy any Go file from go_101 package and run :)
     Bingo ! you ran your first Go program.
